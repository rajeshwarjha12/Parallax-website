        <p class="text">How “Adventure Time” shaped my well-being, as a person, artist, and aspiring animator
            The most significant time of my life didn’t happen in the blink of an eye, but rather it gradually came to me since my early high school years and until now at college age. Surprisingly, it’s not school-related. It was about a kids’ cartoon that hooked me up since my older brother introduced it to me, called “Adventure Time (with Finn and Jake)”. I know it turns people off because of how crazy, trippy and delusional it was to normal people. However, I didn’t see it that way. It was something more than just a wacky cartoon with continuity: it has real depth and hidden meaning.
        <br> <br>
        During a time when I thought my creativity in art was going to be completely banished because of being busy with school, Adventure Time helped me to become inspired again. It’s not mainly from the bad guys Finn and Jake fights, but rather the tender and sweet moments it has.

        <h2>BIKING</h2>
        <p class="text">Man powered machines have been around for quite a long time starting from the 1400’s, however, the closer models of bikes that we see today didn’t come into play until around the 1870’s. Though the exact details of who the inventor of the bike was isn’t quite clear, we know that bikes originally started out as an expensive hobby and as mass production took place the bike became a possible mode of transportation (Palermo). In today’s modern age we can see people riding their bikes to work, renting bikes to explore the city, or getting on their bikes to do some intense exercise. Even though a lot of time has passed since the invention of bikes, they only make up a small portion of the daily used transportation.
        <br> <br>
        Looking at the drawback of not being a leading nation in biking is something that needs to be addressed as there are many reasons why it’s an eminent activity. Biking promotes good health and wellbeing not only for our bodies, but for our environment as well. Carbon dioxide is produced by burning fossil fuels, with the major contributor being automobiles and not only that, but America is responsible for 30% of the carbon dioxide in our air today (Wray). This is what leads to global warming and climate change and in turn, making our lifespan a much shorter one as we neglect to keep up with our own systems.

        <h2 >MOTORCYCLE</h2>
        <p class="text">A motorcycle (or motorbike) is a vehicle used to transport people from one place to another. It does not have 4 wheels like a car. It has 2 wheels like a bicycle, and it has a motor like a car. A motorcycle is usually driven by one person. A passenger can also ride on the back of the motorcycle. Some motorcycles have a sidecar that can carry another passenger.
        <br> <br>
        Since motorcycles are lighter than almost all cars, they can accelerate more quickly. But it also makes them not as safe as cars, because they do not have a protecting chassis around them like cars. Very often motorcycle riders are injured heavily in accidents.

        <h2 >PARAGLIDE</h2>
        <p class="text">paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.

          <br> <br> 
    
          The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain. To launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up like a kite and then runs down the hillside until flying speed has been reached
